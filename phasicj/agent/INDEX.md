# PhasicJ JVMTI Agent

The PhasicJ [JVMTI Agent][jvmti] (a.k.a. "PhasicJ agent" or just "agent") is
responsible for configuring and augmenting a user's JVM such that PhasicJ can
analyze the user's application at run-time.

The agent is implemented in Rust and deployed as a native shared library
(specifically, a Rust crate of type `cdylib`).

The agent is responsible for packaging, deploying, and orchestrating a few key
PhasicJ runtime components:

- [`//phasicj/agent/instr`][instr]. This component is responsible for
  instrumenting the user's JVM application code at class load time. This
  component is built upon the ASM JVM bytecode manipulation library. It is
  compiled (along with ASM) from Java bytecode to native code using GraalVM's
  `native-image` tool. This native code is included as part of the PhasicJ JVMTI
  Agent.

- [`//phasicj/agent/rt`][rt]. This component is responsible for receiving and
  handling the various events generated by the user's JVM application code
  throughout application's execution. This component is implemented in Java. It
  is callable from instrumentation sites because the PhasicJ agent implicitly
  adds these Java classes to the analyzed application's boot class path.
