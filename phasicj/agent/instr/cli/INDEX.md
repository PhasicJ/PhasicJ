# PhasicJ Agent Instrumentation CLI Tool

The PhasicJ performs instrumentation on user-application classes in order to
forward and process various events. This package wraps this instrumentation
functionality into a very simple CLI tool which just transforms input
application class data from stdin into instrumented output class data.
