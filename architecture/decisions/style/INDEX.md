# PhasicJ Style Decisions

The PhasicJ project includes various static artifacts in this repository.
If this project includes some kind of source artifact (e.g. a Markdown file or
a Java source file), this directory should ideally document some style or
conformance guidelines for that kind of source artifact.

Of course, automated style checks are generally preferable to documented style
guidance. If this project supports, implements, or recommends any particular
automated checks, files in this directory should document them.

As an example, [`markdown.md`](markdown.md) describes some style guidelines for
drafting Markdown documents and it describes this Project's automatic tests
which check for style conformance.
