# PhasicJ Architectural Prototypes

This directory holds some software prototypes written to help PhasicJ
development.

An architectural prototype should be a clear, standalone, relatively minimal
example of some set of technologies working together. They are not meant to be
used by clients. They are only meant to help PhasicJ developers study how
certain technical artifacts can be used together. For example, they can help
with

- experimentation
- evaluatation
- illustration

See [`/architecture/decisions/style/prototypes.md`][1] for some style
guidelines.
